In SCD, red blood cells become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a \"sickle.\"\n\nKey Facts:\n• SCD affects millions of people worldwide\n• It's passed down through families (genetic)\n• Red blood cells become sickle-shaped and can block blood flow\n• This causes pain and organ damage over time\n\nTypes of SCD:\n• HbSS (Sickle Cell Anemia) - most common and severe\n• HbSC - generally milder than HbSS\n• HbS beta thalassemia - varies in severity\n\nUnderstanding your specific type helps you and your healthcare team manage your condition better."
